# myminiprojects

this is one of my mini projects as i have just picked up java! Using java swing , i created a java GUI that utilises 2 buttons, one that produces TOTO and the other that produces 4D! 

Additionally, it keeps count of the number of times you have generated each separately! 

This code uses 2 Action Listeners and 2 Buttons ! So it is a simple project that showcases it!
