# myminiprojects

A series of mini projects to brush my programming skills

1. TotoFourD (Java)
- Generates unique number of 4d or TOTO numbers, additionally it keeps track of the count!

2. BMI & Calorie Bot (Python)
- Okay this one is a step up a notch but its because I have been using almost python for quite some time now. 
This project utilises a module called Python Telegram Bot (ptb). It showcases how Query Handlers and MessageTextHandler's can be used effectively. All you need to do is just key in your bot's unique API token into the code and you are good to go!
What it does: 
- Simple bot that is able to store & calculate your calorie intake you have consumed today (hopefully I would be able to track it such that you can keep in multiple days) as well as your BMI! 
- Utilises simple & understandable concepts
