# myminiprojects

A series of mini projects to brush my programming skills

1. TotoFourD (Java)
- Generates unique number of 4d or TOTO numbers, additionally it keeps track of the count!

2. BMI & Calorie Bot (Python)
- Okay this one is a step up a notch but its because I have been solely using python for quite some time now. (It is in fact my main language)
This project utilises a module called Python Telegram Bot (ptb). It showcases how Query Handlers and MessageTextHandler's can be used effectively. All you need to do is just key in your bot's unique API token into the code and you are good to go!
What it does: 
- Simple bot that is able to store & calculate your calorie intake you have consumed today (hopefully I would be able to track it such that you can keep in multiple days) as well as your BMI! 
- Utilises simple & understandable concepts 

3. Weather Bot (Python)
- A simple weather bot that uses OpenWeatherAPI software
- Provides a simple and interactive UI on telegram, able to search for whatever cities in the world 
- Able to save up to 5 different cities 

4. Dashboards (Python)
- A Dashboard that I have created based on the sports participation in Singapore. It is just me showcasing the ability of utilising dash as a whole. (given that it mainly runs in Python). 
- Suggestable that I should learn css html & js to further enhance its ability. 
- Namely used for web analytics and web dev

5. Stockbot (Python)
- Made a stockbot that can track current news affairs (by utilising finnhub API), it can also find the choice of stock (using Ticker symbols)
- Additionally, I have modified it such that it can be deployable to Heroku servers as well... if you wish to find out how please drop me a message
- Stockbot is also able to give the Companies Summary Data, About, P/E & Dividend
(Will be making minor changes to this bot)

6. Newsbot (Python)
- Made a completely deployable newsbot in python. It can gather news from various categories as well as summarise ANY news link you send it.
- Simple to use
- File can be easily deployed to Heroku

7. Restaurant Bot (Python)
- First bot project I have done to completely use Machine learning (Unsupervised)
- Recommends Restaurants based on user location (Or at least when they key it in)
- File can be easily deployed to Heroku! 
- Contains Ipynb which showcases analysis of getting the necessary data
